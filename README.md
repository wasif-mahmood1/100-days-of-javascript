# 100 Days of JavaScript Challenge

This is a repository for my 100-day JavaScript learning challenge. Every day I'll work on a specific concept and post my code along with a brief explanation.

## Plan

### Week 1: Basics of JavaScript
- **Day 1**: Variables and Data Types
- **Day 2**: Operators
- **Day 3**: Control Flow
...
(Continue with the daily breakdown)

## My Progress
### Day 1 - Variables and Data Types
- **Task**: Write a script to declare variables and manipulate them.
- **Code**: [Link to Code](./day-01/index.js)
- **Summary**: I learned how to use `let`, `const`, and `var`, and experimented with different data types like numbers, strings, and booleans.

(Repeat this format daily)
